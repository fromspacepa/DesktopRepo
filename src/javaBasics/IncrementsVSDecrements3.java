		System.out.println(x);//This will still print value of 'x' as '2' as changed above^ by Increment/Pre-Increment.
		
		//Decrement will be "--" (minus minus); This also means Decrement by 1.
		System.out.println(--x);//This will print value of 'x' as '1' because of Decrement/Pre-Decrement.
		System.out.println(x);//This will print value of 'x' as '1' as changed above^ by Decrement/Pre-Decrement.
//In Increment we have Pre-Increment and Post-Increment:
		//Pre-Increment:
		int y = 2;//Here the Variable 'y' is declared and initialized with the assignment of value '2'
		System.out.println(++y);//This is Pre-Increment, it first increases the value of 'y' by '1' and then prints the variable 'y'
		//Now the above^ will print value '3' because of Pre-Increment flow execution.
		System.out.println(y++);//This is Post-Increment, it will still print the value of 'y' as '3' because of the Post-Increment
		//flow execution.
		System.out.println(y);
		
		//Post-Increment:
//The same we have Pre-Decrement and Post-Decrement"
		//Pre-Decrement:
