	 * >>>>> ArrayList:
	 * >>> ArrayList is like Array(s); the difference between ArrayList and Array is that:
	 * __ Arrays are fixed in size, but ArrayList is not fixed in size, ArrayList is dynamic in size.
	 * means, that ArrayList is open in size.
	 * __ In Arrays you can use Primitive Data Types, but in ArrayList you cannot use Primitive Data Types.
	 * __ Another difference is that in Arrays you can have empty indexes, but in ArrayList you cannot have
	 * empty indexes.
	 * __ In Arrays you have to define the size, but in ArrayList you don't have to define the size.
	 * 
	 * >>> As mentioned above ArrayList are not limited to the size, you can have many indexes size 
	 * as you want; you can start with a fixed data type, but then you don't define the size to it.
	 * You can define the initial size to wards the ArrayList to begin with, but then you don't define
	 * the actual ending size of the ArrayList; you can basically keep adding staff (size) to it, and
	 * then ArrayList will manage the size.
	 * 
	 * __ ArrayList is collection or class that is developed, as you can develop a class:
	 * When you get to the collection frame work in Java, you cannot use Primitive Data Types.
	 * (List is one portion of collections and ArrayList is an instance of list)
	 * When you get to the collection, you cannot use Primitives in any of them. The main reason for that
	 * is, the way they are implemented, they are using a concept called Generics; in Generics you can only
	 * pass a Reference data types, you cannot pass Primitive data types.
